                content: `Allah created Prophet Adam (AS) from clay and breathed life into him. He was the first human and the first Prophet. Allah taught Adam the names of everything and made him superior to the angels in knowledge.

Allah created Hawwa (Eve) as Adam's wife, and they lived together in Paradise. Allah told them they could eat from any tree except one special tree.

But Shaytan (Satan) tricked them into eating from the forbidden tree. When they realized their mistake, they felt very sorry and asked Allah to forgive them. Allah is the Most Merciful, so He forgave them.

Allah sent them to Earth and told them that this would be their temporary home. He promised that if they followed His guidance, they would return to Paradise forever.

Prophet Adam taught his children about Allah and how to worship Him. He lived for 930 years and was a great Prophet who loved Allah very much.`,
                moral: "Always obey Allah's commands, and if you make a mistake, ask for forgiveness immediately. Allah loves those who repent sincerely."

                icon: "⛵",
                content: `Prophet Nuh (AS) lived among people who worshipped idols instead of Allah. For 950 years, he called people to worship only Allah, but most of them refused to listen.

The people made fun of Prophet Nuh and rejected his message. Only a few people believed in him. Allah told Nuh to build a giant ship (ark) because a great flood was coming.

Prophet Nuh worked hard building the ark. People laughed at him, asking why he was building a ship when there was no water nearby. But Prophet Nuh continued because he trusted Allah's command.

When the ark was ready, Allah told Nuh to bring his family and two of every animal onto the ship. Then the rain started! It rained so much that the entire Earth was covered with water.

The ark floated safely on the waves while the flood covered everything. Only those on the ark were saved. When the flood ended, the ark landed on a mountain, and they all came out safely.

Prophet Nuh thanked Allah for saving them. This teaches us that Allah always protects those who believe in Him.`,
                moral: "Be patient when facing difficulties, and always trust in Allah's plan. Good things come to those who remain steadfast in faith."

                content: `Prophet Ibrahim (AS) was born in a land where people worshipped idols. Even his own father made and sold idols! But Ibrahim knew these statues of stone and wood were not gods.

One day, when everyone left for a festival, Ibrahim broke all the idols except the biggest one. He put the axe in the hands of the big idol.

When people returned and saw their broken idols, they were very angry! They asked, "Who did this?" Ibrahim said, "Maybe the big idol did it. Ask him if he can speak!"

The people realized their idols couldn't even speak or do anything. But instead of believing in Allah, they decided to punish Ibrahim by throwing him into a huge fire!

They built a massive fire, so big and hot that birds flying above would burn. They threw Prophet Ibrahim into it. But Allah commanded the fire: "O fire! Be cool and safe for Ibrahim!"

Miraculously, the fire didn't burn Ibrahim at all! He sat comfortably in the middle of the flames. When people saw this, they were amazed. Allah had saved His Prophet in a miraculous way!`,

Travelers found Yusuf and sold him as a slave in Egypt. Despite all hardships, Yusuf never complained and remained patient and faithful to Allah.

He was accused of something he didn't do and thrown in prison for years. But he used this time to teach others about Allah.

Eventually, Yusuf's innocence was proven. Because of his wisdom and honesty, the king made him a minister with power over Egypt's storehouses!

Years later, during a famine, Yusuf's brothers came to Egypt for food. They didn't recognize him, but he recognized them. After testing them, he forgave them and was reunited with his family.

The dream Yusuf had as a child came true - his parents and eleven brothers all bowed to him in respect!`,
